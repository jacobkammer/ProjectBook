# Introduction

Antibiotic resistance is increasing world wide in pathogenic microbial populations. Therapeutic and prophylactic use of antibiotics constitutes selective pressure that favors the evolution of antibiotic resistance strains. The durability of a resistance mutation in pathogens is partly determined by it's effect on the fitness of the organism.  Antibiotic resistance mutations usually target key biochemical processes, which impart a fitness cost to the microorganism. The data set used in the evaluation was obtained from the Dryad website. The origin of the data was from the article *The fitness costs of antibiotic resistance mutations* authored by *Melnyk, Wong and Kassen*. 


# Build ATB database 

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```



```{r image, fig.cap="Database Diagram", fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Relationship.jpeg")
```
