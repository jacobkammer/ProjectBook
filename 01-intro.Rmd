# Introduction

Antibiotic resistance is increasing world wide in pathogenic microbial populations. Therapeutic and prophylactic use of antibiotics constitutes selective pressure that favors the evolution of antibiotic resistance strains. The durability of a resistance mutation in pathogens is partly determined by it's effect on the fitness of the organism.  Antibiotic resistance mutations usually target key biochemical processes, which impart a fitness cost to the microorganism. The data set used in the evaluation was obtained from the Dryad website. The origin of the data was from the article *The fitness costs of antibiotic resistance mutations* authored by *Melnyk, Wong and Kassen*.
